    # SI poller -- called from the game's per-frame controller update, once per
    # channel (r3 = channel 0..3), before the pad's SICnINBUFH/L are read.
    #
    # Donkey Kong Country Returns links the Wii SDK's si:: library (SIInit runs
    # at boot) but not the PAD library, so nothing ever enables SI auto-polling and the
    # INBUF registers stay empty on a real console. This programs the
    # hardware itself: it writes the poll command into every channel's
    # SICnOUTBUF, latches it, and enables polling (plus copy-on-vblank) for
    # the channels whose cached si:: type is a confirmed GameCube device.
    #
    # Everything is a subroutine: the wrapper (wrappers.s) saves r3-r31, CR,
    # CTR and LR, points r31 at the patch's scratch area, calls this, restores
    # everything and runs the hooked instruction. Placeholders in braces are
    # filled in per region.
    #
    # SIGetType is called only for a channel whose cached type is not a
    # confirmed standard pad (8 = no response, 0x80 = probe pending, or
    # anything else). si:: never learns this game polls, so for a confirmed
    # pad it would re-probe every ~50 ms and flip the type to pending each
    # time; skipping the call keeps confirmed pads stable and polled.
